# Epsilon-Greedy Stategy
# 1. We define a small number and call it epsilon, we use this epsilon to
#    represent P(explore), the total probability of exploration in the entire
#    game.
# 2. At the start of each action, we randomly generate a number and call it p.
#    If p is smaller than or equal to p, we explore, otherwise, we exploit
#    with the current best choice. With this method, we can make sure that the 
#    total number of exploration is close to the value of epsilon we chose 
#    (if the total number of actions is big enough).
